    <string name="desc_libertarianism">
        Maximum freedom of the economy and the individual. Maximum personality autonomy.
        Libertarians believe that a person has full rights (sovereignty) to his body,
        own life and property obtained as a result of her own efforts or voluntary exchange \n

        What libertarians want to undo: \n
            • Taxes (or at least drastically reduce the amount and reduce the remaining, because,
        from their point of view, this is legalized robbery by the state) \n
            • Conscription \n
            • Punishment for crimes without a victim
                (e.g. drug use, prostitution, arms smuggling, driving in a seat belt) \n
            • Antitrust bans \n
        What libertarians want to legitimize \n
            • Same-sex marriage \n
            • Free carrying weapons \n
            • Euthanasia \n
        What libertarians argue about \n
            • Legalization of all types of immigration \n
            • Abortion - part of the libertarians believe that from an early period of development, the fetus has the same rights,
                as a born person; their opponents believe the abortion ban violates the mother’s right to choose \n
            • Age of sexual consent - some libertarians believe that it should be abolished altogether, \n
            since it is introduced arbitrarily by the authorities and, accordingly, can be considered violent. \n
            • Deprivation of rights due to incapacitation - some libertarians believe that this is also an “attack” on personal autonomy \n
            • International politics - some libertarians reject the right of countries to intervene; another thinks \n
                that they are possible if basic human rights are systematically violated somewhere \n
        \n
        They advocate the so-called minimum state, or a state that acts as a “night watchman”.
        Its functions should be reduced to ensuring national defense, law and order and judicial procedures.
        \n
        Unlike libertarianism, supporters of anarchism against any hierarchies and power, demand the complete elimination of the state.
